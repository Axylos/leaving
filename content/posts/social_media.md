## _This isn't just another self-indulgant announcement about ending a media feed no one cares about in a manner that lacks all self-awareness_

because this one deliberate.  Nor is the obvious bad faith of publicly resolving to withdraw from posting online by way of posting more content online lost on me, but that hasn't stopped anyone before.  

It's kind of like that scene in _Lord of War_ where Nicolas Cage gives Jared Leto one last bump of coke when dropping him off at rehab.  Except in this case there isn't any of the jarring blend of moral decay and misplaced fraternal affection because instead of two people suffering from the tragic alchemy that comes with pairing complementary personality flaws, there is just one person (me) and that person is very, very stupid.

#### Iâ€™ve thought about how to start this post SINCE THE MOMENT I CREATED AN ACCOUNT.

A one-line descriptor is probably the least bullshit fashion to tell the world I won't be shoveling more nonsense into the internet, and it's also on the bottom of my list for obvious reasons.  I wanted to tell a story about my vision quest through facebook and twitter, which is the path I would have taken had this not devolved into a hastily thrown together screed on a Saturday afternoon.

Leaving social media feels like a bigger deal than it should be, which is precisely the reason I wrote an essay about the experience and why you're reading it.  I'm also a much bigger deal than I should be; if I knew I wasn't, this whole exercise might have been avoided.  

_Alas._  

I'll need to break momentarily to let my dog release a splattering puddle of shit onto the neighboring parking lot as a part of my new commitment to focusing, thinking, and smelling in the real world.

### _We were not made for this_

We were made to _complain_ about it while drinking moderately with our coworkers in an appeal to their upper-middle class digital instincts.  I want to take some time to focus building *real* relationships in meat-space rather than tweeting into the void about my prior inability to discover another person willing to subject themselves to literally any random thought that comes tumbling out of my skull.

## BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE I WANT TO BE A THOUGHT-LEADER FOR ALL OF YOU

If I'm going to wander down this road to the core of my massive ego I want to take more than a few innocent bystanders with me.  I'll need a new project to hold my attention, and what better than mentoring newly liberated social-media users about life on the outside.

_You too can put a whole lot of effort into thinking about writing a rambling blog post with liberal use of ALL-CAPS before spending a few hours crafting your magnum opus only to give up around 80% of the way to something almost readable because **jesus** is that a lot of time to waste creating something of no utility to anyone least of all yourself._

Oh, and social media is also full of right-wing nazis now.  Getting away from that is a plus.
