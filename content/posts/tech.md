_There is plenty of self-contempt involved in writing out that title I assure you, so you can feel at peace with yourself reading this essay now that I've met the (very low) bar of confronting that simple fact_

# Why I decided to leave a career in Tech

I guess you could just say it's not worth it anymore--assuming you're not talking about money, in which case it most _definitely_ is "worth it".

I've spent the last 5-15 years in tech, and it's been a whole lot of fun.  I'm fascinated by complex systems, so getting paid to play with them has some obvious perks.  But my heart just isn't in it anymore.  I can't really justify spending 40 hours a week building addictive social media functionality on top of an app that most certainly doesn't need it when I could go off to focus on amateur farming in Colorado and live off the lottery-winning-scale equity I was able to secure at several fast-growing firms.  

After a lot of deep soul searching I suppose there is no other alternative for someone with marketable skills than to pen a lengthy, morose reflection on petty nerd squabbles and proudly march out of California (the topic of a forthcoming article about another thing I'm leaving) into an early retirement.

#### A large proportion of software products are born because someone realized that they could write some code to automate a tedious process and sell it.

As opposed to other products that lack the automation part.  I don't want to work a job that supports some minor and very boring component of providing a dry and uninteresting service.  Fortunately for me, I've been paid out the wazoo for a pretty brief period of time, so I am able to throw my dick down and wander around the world not doing anything for rest of my working years.

I'll complain about it some more, and you'll listen because a walking bad-acid-trip like that shouldn't be ignored.  Enjoy Accounting.  Maybe you too can cash in and start an emu farm at some point mid-career.



### I will also be joining the adventure lifestyle/action sports industry

Because I heard you can learn how to be a racacar driver, and honestly that sounds badass.

Now that I've spent the better part of the first half of my career in a navel-gazing social position with handsome rewards, the interminable bickering that I just can't help but wallow in has forced me into a navel-gazing social position (in Colorado) where there will be less bickering and more spending what I've earned on idle pleasures.  Go me!

## You should quit tech too!

But not until you've made a boat-load of money and want to further isolate not just digitially but _physically_ on a personal compound in the mountains.
